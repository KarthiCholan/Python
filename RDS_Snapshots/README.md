# Python program to Automate RDS Snapshots



Steps to Automate RDS Snapshots:

AWS IAM Permissions:
Ensure your AWS IAM role for Lambda has the necessary permissions to create RDS snapshots (rds:CreateDBSnapshot) and describe RDS instances (rds:DescribeDBInstances).

Create an AWS Lambda Function:

Write a Lambda function using a supported language like Python, Node.js, etc. You'll need to use the AWS SDK for the language you choose.
The Lambda function should utilize the AWS SDK to trigger the creation of RDS snapshots for the desired RDS instances.

Lambda Configuration:

Configure the Lambda function with appropriate environment variables or input parameters to specify the RDS instance(s) for which you want to create snapshots.
Set the necessary timeout and memory allocation for the Lambda function.

AWS EventBridge:

Create a AWS EventBridge rule that triggers the Lambda function on a schedule.
Define the schedule using cron expressions (e.g., every day at a specific time).
