# Python program to create EBS Snapshots using Lambda and AWS EventBridge

Create an IAM Role: Start by creating an IAM role that grants Lambda the necessary permissions to describe, create, and manage EBS snapshots.


Create a Lambda Function:

Go to AWS Lambda in the AWS Management Console.
Click "Create Function" and choose "Author from Scratch."
Configure the function:
Name it appropriately.
Choose the runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js).
Assign the IAM role created earlier.
Write the Lambda function code to automate EBS snapshots
Set up Trigger: Configure AWS EventBridge as a trigger for the Lambda function.

Go to AWS EventBridge.
Create a new rule, specifying the schedule (e.g., cron expression) for when you want the snapshots to be taken.
Select the Lambda function as the target for the rule.
